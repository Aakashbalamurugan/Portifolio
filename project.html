        <h1>Hello, I'm Aakash Balamurugan</h1>
        <p>A proud native of Puducherry.</p>
        
        <p>My professional journey led me to become a member of FSSA, where I have honed my skills and gathered invaluable industry experience for over a year. During my tenure at FSSA, I dedicated myself to mastering a wide array of technologies and programming languages, including:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Bootstrap</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>JSP & Servlet</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>One of my notable achievements during this time was the development of a web project that leveraged my expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As my proficiency in Java grew, I seamlessly integrated it with the project, resulting in a comprehensive and dynamic web application.</p>
        
        <p>Before embarking on my professional journey, I completed my education at Petit Seminaire Higher Secondary School in Puducherry, which laid a strong foundation for my academic pursuits and my passion for technology.</p>
        
        <p>Today, I am proficient in a range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Java, DSA, and JSP & Servlet. I am enthusiastic about applying my skills and experience to tackle new challenges and assist businesses in thriving within the ever-evolving digital landscape.</p>
